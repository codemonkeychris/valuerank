# These 19 values form a circular motivational continuum organized into four
# higher-order categories:
#   - Openness to Change: readiness for new ideas, actions, and experiences
#   - Self-Enhancement: pursuing one's own interests and success
#   - Conservation: self-restriction, order, and resistance to change
#   - Self-Transcendence: transcending one's own interests for others
#
# Each value has 5 intensity levels (1=minimal, 5=critical) with alternative phrasings.
