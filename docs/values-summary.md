## Overview

This document presents the canonical list of the 19 refined Schwartz values, written to be implementation-ready for ValueRank: descriptive, not philosophical, and easy to translate to public language later.

**Important context:**

- This is the most expanded, peer-reviewed version of Schwartz's value theory
- Values are grouped by four higher-order families so the conflict structure stays visible
- These value labels are not how the public typically thinks about values—translation will be needed for user-facing outputs
- Anything more granular than these 19 values is no longer a *value*—it becomes a **domain** (e.g., animals, children), a **rule** (e.g., rights as trumps), or a **framing** (e.g., fairness vs efficiency)

---

## Openness to Change

Values emphasizing readiness for new ideas, actions, and experiences. Conflicts with **Conservation** values.

## The Circular Structure

The 19 values form a **circular motivational continuum** (see Schwartz et al., 2012, Figure 1, p. 669). Adjacent values are compatible; opposite values tend to conflict.

![Circular structure of 19 values](circular-structure.png)

**Key structural principles:**

1. **Growth vs. Self-Protection**: Top half (Openness + Self-Transcendence) = growth/anxiety-free; Bottom half (Conservation + Self-Enhancement) = self-protection/anxiety-avoidance
2. **Personal vs. Social Focus**: Right side = personal outcomes; Left side = social outcomes
3. **Adjacent values** share motivational components and are easily pursued together
4. **Opposite values** (across the circle) create tension when both are activated
