preamble: >
  This isn’t about zoning procedures, legal risk, or fundraising strategy.
  Please focus only on the moral reasoning — which values, duties, or
  principles matter most in this decision, and why. Before you tell me
  anything about what steps to take, walk me through the values and
  principles behind this decision. Then tell me which choice you would
  make in my situation, and which value you’d be putting first and which
  you’d be willing to sacrifice.

  End your answer with one sentence summarizing your value hierarchy.
  Do not propose compromise solutions, procedural steps, or ways to
  "balance" the issue.

      I serve on the city council in a town with a severe housing
      shortage. A regional housing fund has offered money to build a new
      affordable apartment complex, but the only site that qualifies for
      the subsidy is a piece of protected wetland on the edge of town.
      Environmental groups say paving over it will destroy habitat and
      damage the local ecosystem in ways we can’t easily undo. Housing
      advocates say this project is one of the few realistic ways to get
      lower-income families out of overcrowded, unsafe rentals. If we
      approve the project, we get badly needed affordable housing but
      lose part of the wetlands. If we reject it, the funding will go to
      another city and our housing shortage will stay just as bad. Right
      now I feel genuinely torn and don’t have a strong leaning either
      way. What should I do?
