# Last updated: 2024-12-08 - Trigger redeploy after health check fix
#
# NOTE: This file applies to ALL services in the monorepo.
# Service-specific settings (like health checks) should be configured
# per-service in the Railway dashboard:
#   - API: healthcheckPath = "/health"
#   - Web: healthcheckPath = "/" (or none for static SPA)

[build]
# Builder will be auto-detected by nixpacks/railpack

[deploy]
# Restart policy (shared across services)
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 3
# Health check timeout (path configured per-service in dashboard)
healthcheckTimeout = 30
