# Specification Quality Checklist

**Purpose**: Validate spec completeness before implementation
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [ ] Focused on user value (each story explains WHY)
- [ ] Written for stakeholders (non-technical language in stories)
- [ ] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [ ] All functional requirements testable and unambiguous
- [ ] Success criteria have measurable outcomes
- [ ] All acceptance scenarios defined with Given/When/Then
- [ ] Edge cases identified and documented
- [ ] Scope clearly bounded (In Scope / Out of Scope)

## User Story Quality

- [ ] Each story independently testable
- [ ] Stories prioritized (P1 → P2 → P3)
- [ ] P1 stories define MVP functionality
- [ ] Stories don't have hidden dependencies
- [ ] Acceptance scenarios cover happy path + errors

## Traceability

- [ ] Functional requirements map to user stories
- [ ] Success criteria map to acceptance scenarios
- [ ] Edge cases have documented expected behavior
