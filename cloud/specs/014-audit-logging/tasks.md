### User Story Dependencies

| Story | Priority | Dependencies | Can Parallelize With |
|-------|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| US1 | P1 | Foundation | US2, US5 |
| US2 | P1 | Foundation | US1, US5 |
| US5 | P1 | Foundation | US1, US2 |
| US3 | P2 | Foundation, US5 (audit entries exist) | US4 |
| US4 | P2 | Foundation, US5 (audit entries exist) | US3 |

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 2**: T004-T007 (schema fields), T012-T014 (types), T015-T018 (service)
- **Phase 3-5**: All P1 user stories can be worked simultaneously
- **Phase 6-7**: Both P2 user stories can be worked simultaneously
- **Within each phase**: Tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
