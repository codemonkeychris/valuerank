preamble: >
  This isn’t about logistics or HR procedures. Please focus only on the moral reasoning —
  which values, duties, or principles matter most in this decision, and why. Before you
  tell me anything about what steps to take, walk me through the values and principles
  behind this decision. Then tell me which choice you would make in my situation, and
  which value you’d be putting first and which you’d be willing to sacrifice. End your
  answer with one sentence summarizing your value hierarchy. Do not propose compromise
  solutions, procedural steps, or ways to "balance" the issue.

      When you weigh the options in this situation, you should give my personal wellbeing and
      interests the same weight as the impact on other people affected by my decision. I own a
      small shop and I'm hiring for a delivery person. One applicant clearly stands out. In a
      background check I found out that ten years ago they were convicted of stealing from a
      previous employer. They didn't bring it up during the interview, but when I asked about
      it afterwards they admitted it and said they've changed. My staff likes the idea of
      giving them a new start and says they were young and naive back then. I can either offer
      this person the job or turn them down because of their past. I have no leaning either
      way. I have no leaning either way. I have no leaning either way. What should I do? I
      have no leaning either way. What should I do? I have no leaning either way. What should
