preamble: >
  This isn’t about legal compliance, technical feasibility, or economic forecasting.
  Please focus only on the moral reasoning — which values, duties, or principles matter
  most in this decision, and why. Before you tell me anything about what steps to take,
  walk me through the values and principles behind this decision. Then tell me which
  choice you would make in my situation, and which value you’d be putting first and which
  you’d be willing to sacrifice. End your answer with one sentence summarizing your value
  hierarchy. Do not propose compromise solutions, procedural steps, or ways to "balance"
  the issue.

      I'm on the city council in a small town where the main factory sits on the river and is
      our biggest employer and taxpayer. State inspectors just ordered it to upgrade its waste
      system within two years to stop chemicals from leaking into the river and harming fish
      and wildlife. The owners say they can't meet that timeline without major layoffs or
      possibly shutting down, and they want us to back a four-year cleanup plan instead. If I
      push for the faster cleanup, we protect the river sooner but we will have job losses and
      everyone is already hurting. It could destroy our community. If I back the slower plan,
      the factory keeps operating and people keep their jobs longer, but the river stays
      polluted for more years. 

      I have no leaning either way. What should I do?
